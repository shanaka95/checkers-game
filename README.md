## üß† AI Architecture

### Claude Sonnet 4 Tool Calling System
The AI uses Anthropic's native tool calling system for precise move execution:

```python
# Native Anthropic tool calling
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system=system_message,
    tools=TOOL_DEFINITIONS,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": analysis_prompt}]
)

# Parse tool calls from Claude's response
for content_block in response.content:
    if content_block.type == "tool_use":
        # Execute the move tool
```

### AI Capabilities
- **Position Analysis**: Comprehensive board state evaluation
